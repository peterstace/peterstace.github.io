<h1>Go, gofmt, and diffs</h1>
<div>2015-06-02, Peter Stace</div>
<div><p><a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">Gofmt</a> is a Go program formatter. Its universal
adoption by the Go community has resulted in a consistent formatting style
among most if not all Go source code.</p>
<p>When making changes to Go code, gofmt sometimes causes changes to lines of code
that weren&rsquo;t originally modified. This can done for example to keep indentation
consistent. This can make diffs hard to read.</p>
<p>For example, the following is a diff of a simple
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Type_declarations">type declaration</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git diff
diff --git a/main.go b/main.go
index 2c7af41..d9e59cd 100644
--- a/main.go
+++ b/main.go

-    bandersnatch float64

     }
 }

<p>Because gofmt has rewritten the source code to have consistent indentation, at
least a whitespace change has been made to every line. It can be hard to see
what the <em>real</em> change is.</p>
<p>To see the real changes, the diff algorithm should be configured to ignore
whitespace. The diff below makes it quite obvious what the actual change is:</p>
<pre><code>$ git diff -b
diff --git a/main.go b/main.go
index 2c7af41..d9e59cd 100644
--- a/main.go
+++ b/main.go

 }
</code></pre>
<p>It&rsquo;s now quite clear that <code>quux</code> has had its type modified, <code>bandersnatch</code> has
been removed, and <code>tumtummy</code> has been moved from the inner struct, to the outer
struct.</p>
<p>This type of diff can typically be created by passing the
<code>--ignore-space-change</code> flag (the short version is <code>-b</code>). This works with Git,
Mercurial, Subversion, and well as the <code>diff</code> command that comes with
<code>diffutils</code>.  GUI based diffs such as those <a href="https://github.com/blog/967-github-secrets">produced by
Github</a> will typically have an
ignore-whitespace option as well.</p>
