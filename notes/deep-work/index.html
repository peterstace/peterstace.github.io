<h1>Deep Work</h1>
<div>2020-07-21, Peter Stace</div>
<div><p>The following are notes that I took while reading <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">Cal Newport&rsquo;s Deep
Work</a>.</p>
<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
<p>The defining characteristics of <em>Deep Work</em> are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Work performed while in a distraction-free state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must either improve your skills, or create new value (or both).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must be hard for others (en masse) to emulate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>Deep Work Hypothesis</em> asserts the following are true:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deep work is becoming increasingly valuable over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep work is becoming increasingly rare over time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If this hypothesis is true, then an argument from economics can be made that it
is advantageous for individuals to pursue deep work. In an environment where
demand is high and supply is low, it&rsquo;s good to be a supplier.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>
<p><strong>Deep work is valuable.</strong></p>
<p>Deep work will allow you to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Quickly learn new skills that are non-trivial and difficult to acquire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Produce at an elite level with respect to both speed and quality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To improve your understanding of a field, you have to study all of the relevant
topics systematically. To do this requires intense concentration. For the
majority of fields, skill doesn&rsquo;t have to do with natural abilities. Rather,
skill evolves due to life-spanning efforts to improve performance. Deep work
has help to shortcut the learning process.</p>
<p>High Quality Work := (Time Spent) * (Intensity of Focus)</p>
<p>This implies that both time and intense focus are required, not just one or the
other.</p>
<p>Beware the <em>attention residue</em>. This is the residue of attention left on a
previous task when switching context.</p>
<p>But what about Jack Dorsey (Square and Twitter). He famously does <em>not</em> do deep
work, but is still highly productive and produces high levels of value. The key
is in his role. Roles such as CEO (and other niche roles) don&rsquo;t follow
conventional wisdom when it comes to deep work.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h3>
<p><strong>Deep work is rare.</strong></p>
<p>New business trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working in <em>open offices</em>.</li>
<li>Communicating via <em>instant messaging</em>.</li>
<li>Content producers being present on <em>social media</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all distractions that push <em>away</em> from cultivating intense focus.</p>
<p>Why has this happened? Because of <strong>The Principle of Least Resistance</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a business setting, if there isn&rsquo;t clear feedback around what most impacts
the bottom line, then the business will tend towards behaviour that is
easiest in the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reason is <strong>busyness can be a proxy for productivity</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If clear indicators are not available to indicate a knowledge worker&rsquo;s
productivity and value, then that worker will default towards a more
<em>industrial</em> way to show their worth: busyness. Specifically, busyness in a
highly visible manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This whole situation (deep work <em>rarity</em>) is very bad for business, but it&rsquo;s
good for you (if you can leverage it).</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h3>
<p><strong>Deep work is meaningful.</strong></p>
<p>Meaningfulness in this context is about satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are 3 arguments as to why deep work is meaningful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neurological argument</li>
<li>Psychological argument</li>
<li>Philosophical argument</li>
</ul>
<p>Our quality of life is in large determined by what we choose to focus on and
what we choose to ignore. Our circumstances (what happens and doesn&rsquo;t happen to
use) has less of an impact than we think. By focusing attention, we aren&rsquo;t
able to focus on the smaller details in life (which are often less pleasant).</p>
<p>Jobs can be easier to enjoy compared to free time. This is because jobs are
(usually) better structured, with challenges and feedback loops. This helps you
to get lost in your work. Free time can require a large amount of effort to get
lost into. When empirically studied, people are happier at work and less happy
during free time than they expected.</p>
<p>Craftsmanship can create meaning, especially when abilities are honed with
respect and care.  It&rsquo;s not rarified jobs that create meaning; it&rsquo;s rarified
approaches to work. Cultivating craftsmanship requires deep work.</p>
<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>
<p>Part 2 is about the rules you need to follow in order to work deeply.</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-work-deeply">Rule 1: Work Deeply</h3>
<p>Ideally, we would have access to an environment (both workspace and people &amp;
culture) that is geared towards extracting as much value from the brains of
knowledge workers as possible. Instead, we have inboxes, needless meetings, and
&lsquo;always on&rsquo; instant messaging.</p>
<p>We need &ldquo;Discipline of depth in a shallow world&rdquo; to overcome this. We need
strategies to mimic the effect of the Eudaimonia Machine (because such a
machine doesn&rsquo;t exist).</p>
<p>The primary obstacles to deep work is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The urge to turn your attention to matters that are superficial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a finite amount of willpower that gets depleted as you use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can use rituals and routines as a substitute for willpower in order to
achieve a state of concentration.  This is useful both for when there is not
much will power left, and as a strategy to preserve will power for later.
Willpower is your brain&rsquo;s &ldquo;mana bar&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="decide-on-your-depth-philosophy">Decide on Your Depth Philosophy</h4>
<p>Both shallow and deep work are important for most professionals. There are 4
approaches to manage when to perform deep work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monastic, e.g. Donald Knuth. Eliminate all distractions. Only venture out of
your cave when absolutely required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bimodal, e.g. Carl Jung. Monastic for 1 to 5 days at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rhythmic. Steady, habitual progress in small (1 to 3 hour) chunks of planned
deep work. This is the most realistic approach to deep work for the majority
of office workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journalistic. Opportunistically use pockets of time for deep work as they
become available. &ldquo;Just In Time&rdquo; scheduling approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ritualize">Ritualize</h4>
<p>Waiting for inspiration and enthusiasm to strike is a bad plan.</p>
<p>Think like an artist, but execute like an accountant.</p>
<p>Rituals should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strict.</li>
<li>Idiosyncratic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rituals minimise the effort (friction) required to go deep. This reduces the
willpower spent on the mechanics of entering and remaining in the deep work
state.</p>
<p>Rituals have a few different aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where and how long: The physical location should be limited to a few places.
The effort should be over a discrete time period, rather than an open ended slog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How you&rsquo;ll work: These are rules around what you can and can&rsquo;t do. What
metrics should be tracked?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support: food, stimulants, exercise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="make-grand-gestures">Make Grand Gestures</h4>
<p>Invest time or money into a &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; that supports the deep work effort. This
&ldquo;tricks&rdquo; the mind into more easily slipping into the deep work state.</p>
<p>They are more effective if they are novel.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s really about the psychology of the commitment.</p>
<p>In for a penny, in for a pound.</p>
<h4 id="dont-work-alone">Don&rsquo;t Work Alone</h4>
<p>Serendipitous creativity is creativity that happens &ldquo;by chance&rdquo; when
interacting with other knowledge workers.</p>
<p>There are advantages to an open office, some are taken from a cynical mindset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased supervision, making it easier to manage lazy workers.</li>
<li>Space saving, resulting a lower office rental expense.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there is another often overlooked advantage:</p>
<ul>
<li>New ideas emerge from having smart people bump into each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concentration is needed to support inspiration (otherwise the inspired thoughts
cannot be executed into something useful). Inspiration is fueled by mixing your
ideas with the ideas of others. To extract maximum value, you need both
concentration and inspiration. They complement each other, but you can only be
in one mode at a time. Trying both at once will make them both suffer.</p>
<p>Working with someone else at a metaphorical &ldquo;shared whiteboard&rdquo; can push you
deeper compared to working alone. But it only works if you are both dedicated
to going deep, e.g. pair programming.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to separate your pursuit of serendipitous creativity from
efforts to think deeply, since the two impede each other.</p>
<h4 id="execute-like-a-business">Execute Like A Business</h4>
<p>Separate the How vs the What, i.e. the Plan vs the Execution.</p>
<p>4DX framework is about 4 Disciplines of eXecution, from the business consulting
world. It&rsquo;s a useful framework for when something important needs to be done
against a backdrop of other competing concerns.</p>
<p>Discipline 1: Focus on the wildly important. For deep work, that means to focus
on the few most important things in your deep work time. Don&rsquo;t spread yourself
too thin.</p>
<p>Discipline 2: Act on the lead measures. Lag measures are useful for measuring
the success of long term goals. Leads measures are for short term goals.
Nothing you do day-to-day can immediately change lag measures. But lead
measures can be immediately impacted by day to day decisions. Lead measures are
the best way to adjust your course day to day.</p>
<p>Discipline 3: Keep a compelling scoreboard: &ldquo;People play differently when
they&rsquo;re keeping score&rdquo;. This score board should primarily be for lead measures.
The key lead measures for deep work are the number of ours in that store. So
keep a scoreboard of hours worked deep.</p>
<p>Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability: Teams owning Wildly
Important Goals should meet regularly to confront their score boards, and
discuss what they can do to improve their lead measures. For deep work, a
weekly review could suffice. 1) Review the scoreboard. 2) Celebrate wins. 3)
Identify what went wrong on bad weeks. 4) Plan to optimise for the week ahead.</p>
<h4 id="be-lazy">Be Lazy</h4>
<p>Small obligations seem harmless in isolation, but cause great injury to the
deep work effort at an aggregate level.</p>
<p>Idleness is not just something for &ldquo;fun&rdquo; or &ldquo;relaxation&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s actually
important for the mind&rsquo;s health, and is an important aspect of being able to
work deeply.</p>
<p>Shutdown all thinking about when when you&rsquo;re &ldquo;clocked off&rdquo; from work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Downtime adds insight</strong>. This occurs via subconscious thoughts, i.e. the
&ldquo;shower effect&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Downtime helps recharge the batteries</strong>. Specifically, the batteries
required to work deeply. It allows you to recover from &ldquo;attention fatigue&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excess work done is of little value</strong>. When in a worn out state, any extra
work will be of low quality. Only shallow work is possible. The time is
better spent recharging, allowing a better deep work effort the next day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should use a &ldquo;shutdown ritual&rdquo;. This is a ritual that&rsquo;s performed at the
end of each day. For each incomplete goal/task:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have a plan that you trust will end in its completion. This could be
delegation or automation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that&rsquo;s not possible (and it often isn&rsquo;t), then make sure the task is
captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>End the ritual with a phrase that conditions the mind to release work related
thoughts. E.g. &ldquo;shutdown complete&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The shutdown ritual helps to avoid the Zeigarnik effect, whereby incomplete or
unresolved tasks distract out attention.</p>
<p>Any incomplete task can be temporarily resolved by making a plan about how to
resolve it later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you work, work hard. When you&rsquo;re done, be done&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-embrace-boredom">Rule 2: Embrace Boredom</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The above quotation is shows the difference compared to a &ldquo;habit&rdquo;. If it were a
habit, that implies that it&rsquo;s something that you know how to do, and you know
it&rsquo;s good for you, but you&rsquo;ve just been neglecting it due to lack of
motivation. It also implies that you can concentrate intensely if you just find
the right motivation. Thinking this way is doing yourself a disservice, because
it sets the wrong expectations around how to actually get good at working
deeply. It ignores the training aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend
the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who multitask all the time can&rsquo;t filter out irrelevancy. They&rsquo;re
chronically distracted.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re used to &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; distraction, e.g. checking twitter while waiting
in line at the supermarket checkout, then your brain has been re-wired away
from its natural state. It will be hard to do deep work, even if you succeed in
forming a habit to regularly schedule it.</p>
<p>Getting the most out of a deep work habit requires training:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Train to improve your ability to concentrate intensely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train to overcome your desire to seek out distraction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="dont-take-breaks-from-distraction-take-breaks-from-focus">Don&rsquo;t take breaks from distraction. Take breaks from focus.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Once you&rsquo;re wired for distraction, you crave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Internet Sabbath (also known as Digital Detox) is a technique to put aside
1 day per week away from networking technology. The trouble with this idea is
that it doesn&rsquo;t do much to help rewire the brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you eat healthy just one day a week, you&rsquo;re unlikely to lose weight, as the
majority of your time is still spent gorging&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The problem is switching from low stimuli (high value) activities to high
stimuli (low value) activities at the slightest hint of challenge or boredom.</p>
<p>Distractions (e.g. Internet use) should be scheduled in. In the time leading up
to those scheduled distractions, you&rsquo;re performing mental calisthenics.</p>
<p>Point #1: This works even if your job requires email/Slack/Internet:</p>
<ul>
<li>The frequency of your online blocks doesn&rsquo;t matter so much as the
&ldquo;integrity&rdquo; of your offline blocks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Point #2: No matter how the internet blocks are scheduled, you must keep the
time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use:</p>
<ul>
<li>This may mean that you have to <em>change</em> your schedule on the fly if you
need to use the Internet. but leave at least 5 minutes until the scheduled
time as a behavioural separation between needing the Internet and getting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Point #3: Use this scheduling technique at home, not just at work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This means don&rsquo;t be glued to a smartphone or laptop after work (unless it&rsquo;s
scheduled). Doing so would undo the mental training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t to reduce or eliminate internet usage in the evening. But
instead to provide opportunities to risist switching to these distractions
at the slightest hint of boredom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hardest context to do this is when you&rsquo;re forced to &ldquo;wait&rdquo;, e.g.
checkout line, microwave etc. You <strong>MUST</strong> wait out the boredom.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The training points (1 to 3) will help you resist temptation in a way that
requires less effort over time.</p>
<h4 id="work-like-teddy-roosevelt">Work Like Teddy Roosevelt</h4>
<p>Roosevelt didn&rsquo;t spend much time studying, but yet still got respectable
grades.</p>
<p>From the 8:30AM to 4:30PM time block, he removed recitation, classes, athletic
training, and lunch. This didn&rsquo;t leave much, but the remaining time was spent
studying. This study time was brief but intense.</p>
<p>Method: when you have a task, estimate the <em>normal</em> time it would take to
complete. Half this time. Publicly commit to the time line (if possible). This
will force you to work intensely. Can use a countdown timer.</p>
<p>This is a training exrecrise. Trying it once per week to start with.</p>
<p>Keep the goal in reach. You should beat the buzzer 80% of the time.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Roosevelt Dash&rdquo; is an Interval Training Program for your mind.</p>
<h4 id="meditate-mindfully">Meditate Mindfully</h4>
<p>While the body is busy (e.g. commuting) but the mind is otherwise unspoken for,
productive meditation can be used.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s similar to mindful meditation - when you notice your concentration
stalling, recognise it objectively and move back to task.</p>
<p>The technique is more of a way to help improve ones ability to think deeply. It
is less about the productivity gains from the meditation itself (e.g.
inspiration of how to solve a problem).</p>
<p>There are two suggestions to make this more successful:</p>
<p><strong>1. Be wary of distractions and looping.</strong></p>
<p>Distractions occur when more interesting thoughts enter your mind. When you
notice this, recognise it happening, remind yourself that you can come back to
that thought later, and focus your mind back to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Looping is when the mind rehashes back to already solved parts of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>2. Structure your Deep Thinking.</strong></p>
<p>Once you have a distraction free mental landscape, and hard problem, and time
to think, what are the next steps? Structure can help here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First step: what are the relevant key facts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second step: based on these facts, what is the next step (the next question
to answer, or the next task to complete)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third step: Solve the question or perform the action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forth step: Consolidate by reviewing clearly what was found and how you got
there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fifth step: repeat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="memorise-a-deck-of-cards">Memorise a Deck of Cards</h4>
<p>Memorizing a deck of cards is a skill that has more to do with being able to
concentrate and pay attention, than memory itself.</p>
<p>Learning to memorize a deck of cards is a basic trick of the memory athlete.</p>
<p>This is something that I&rsquo;d like to try out.</p>
<h4 id="quit-social-media">Quit Social Media</h4>
<p>Social media + Infotainment == Network tools.</p>
<p>Network tools fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not practical to quit network tools entirely.</p>
<p>A more realistic approach is a middle ground. Reduce the number of network
tools used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Network tool selection&rdquo; is the process of choosing which social network(s) you
use.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Any Benefit&rdquo; approach selects to use a particular network tool if it
provides <em>any</em> benefit. But this ignores the negatives. Network tools can be
harmful.</p>
<p>Network tools are <em>designed</em> to be adictive.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to network tool select is the &ldquo;craftsman approach&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Identify the core factors that determine success and hapiness in your
professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impact on
these factors substantially outweighs its negative impacts.</p>
<h4 id="apply-the-law-of-the-vital-few-to-your-internet-habits">Apply the Law of the Vital Few To Your Internet Habits</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are your high level personal and professional goals? This is the first
question to ask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What activities support those goals?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which network tools have a positive impact on those activities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>80/20: 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes. This
is the &ldquo;Law of the Vital Few&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to identify the 20% &ndash; the 2 or 3 out of a list of 16
activities that are most important to focus on.</p>
<h4 id="dont-use-the-internet-to-entertain-yourself">Don&rsquo;t use the Internet to Entertain Yourself</h4>
<p>Our way of thinking about leisure time has not changed much in the last 100
years.</p>
<p>Our leisure time is now a blur of distracted clicks on least-common-denominator
digital entertainment.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> and <em>should</em> make deliberate use of your time outside of your 9-5
work day.</p>
<p>Examples of entertainment based websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huffington Post,</li>
<li>Buzzfeed,</li>
<li>Business Insider</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
</ul>
<p>They use carefully crafted titles and easily digestible content. It&rsquo;s designed
to be maximally attention grabbing.</p>
<p>These are dangerous after the work day is done, because they weaken the minds
ability to concentrate.</p>
<p>Arnold Bennet identified the solution 100 years ago: &ldquo;Put more thought into
your leisure time.&rdquo;. In other words, put in some advanced thinking and planning
rather than just letting something grab your attention.</p>
<p>But won&rsquo;t you get tired if you&rsquo;re always fully structured and never get a
break? NO. If you spent your time in more meaningfully and purposefully, then
you will feel fulfilled and satisfied, and feel more relaxed the next day.</p>
<p>The easiest way to steer clear from wasted time on social media and
infotainment is to give your mind some planned better alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-drain-the-shallows">Rule 4: Drain the Shallows</h3>
<p>Very few people work even 8 hours per day. Other hours are spent in meetings,
getting distracted by colleagues, office politics, personal business, and
surfing the web.</p>
<p>If you have fewer hours, you spend them more wisely.  Shallow work is forcibly
eliminated.</p>
<p>Identify the &ldquo;shallow&rdquo; in your life and then cull it down to a minimum level.</p>
<p>The limit of deep work per day is about 4 hours.</p>
<p>Shallow work isn&rsquo;t bad unless it crowds out your 4 hours of week work. But that
can happen more easily than you expect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly
underestimated and its importance is vastly overestimated.&rdquo;</p>
