<ol>
<li>d4</li>
</ol>
<p>White intends the London system.</p>
<ol>
<li>&hellip;b5</li>
</ol>
<p>Black uses the Polish defence.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bf4</li>
</ol>
<p>Dark squared Bishop is developed as per the London system.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>&hellip; e5</li>
</ol>
<p>Black hangs the King&rsquo;s pawn. It&rsquo;s attacked twice but is undefended.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Bxe5</li>
</ol>
<p>White captures the undefended king&rsquo;s pawn using the bishop. The alternative was
to capture using the pawn. This was decided against because it would break the
London opening pawn structure.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>&hellip; Ba6</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear why Black played this move. The b-pawn is now defended,
however the bishop cannot see its main a6-f1 diagonal because it&rsquo;s blocked by
the b-pawn.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Nf3</li>
</ol>
<p>White develops the knight as per the London system.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>&hellip; h5</li>
</ol>
<p>Black pushed their h-pawn to allow future activation of their king-side rook.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>e3</li>
</ol>
<p>White pushes the e-pawn into its London system position, and adds a third
defender to the d-pawn (the queen and knight already defend). The engine
suggests e4, Nbd2, or a2 as stronger moves. I didn&rsquo;t consider e4 since I wanted
to stay in the London system. And Nbd2 would block in the queen. And a2 doesn&rsquo;t
seem appealing.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>&hellip; Rh6</li>
</ol>
<p>Black activates their rook.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Bf4</li>
</ol>
<p>White attacks the rook. The engine says this is the best move.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>&hellip; Be7</li>
</ol>
<p>Black actives their bishop but without an attack or threat, leaving their rook
underdefended against White&rsquo;s bishop. The rook is defended by the knight and
g-pawn. However, the attacking bishop is worth less than the bishop.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Bxh6</li>
</ol>
<p>White takes the underdefended rook.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>&hellip; gxh6</li>
</ol>
<p>Black takes back with the g-pawn. This leaves them with doubled pawns on the h
file. If Black had instead taken back with the knight, then they would have
kept a better pawn structure, albeit with a knight on the edge of the board.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Bd3</li>
</ol>
<p>White actives their light bishop as per the London system.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>&hellip; Kf8</li>
</ol>
<p>Black moves their king, giving up the right to castle. It&rsquo;s not immediately
obvious to me why Black did this. The engine states that this is the best move,
although I&rsquo;m not sure why.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>O-O</li>
</ol>
<p>White castles because development is almost complete. The only minor piece left
to develop is the queen-side knight.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>&hellip; Bb4</li>
</ol>
<p>Black further develops their dark bishop (the second time it has moved). It may
have been better for them to move the bishop to b4 initially.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>c3</li>
</ol>
<p>White pushes the c-pawn to put pressure on the dark squared bishop. The bishop
cannot take c3, since it is defended by the b-pawn. And it cannot move to a3,
since that would be attacked by the b-pawn. So it is forced to retreat, gaining
White a tempo.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>&hellip; Ba5</li>
</ol>
<p>Black retreats the bishop to a5 in order to avoid losing it. It is now trapped
with very few places to go. It may have been better for Black to retreat to d6
or e7, because White can play b4 winning the bishop.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>b4</li>
</ol>
<p>White attacks the bishop and is defended by the c-pawn. This forces the bishop
to retreat again.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>&hellip; h4</li>
</ol>
<p>Black must not have seen the immediate threat on the bishop and does not
respond to it.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>bxa5</li>
</ol>
<p>White carries out the threat on the dark squared bishop.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>&hellip; Ke8</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear why Black made this move. The engine suggests h3 instead, which
would have threatened to remove the g-pawn in front of White&rsquo;s king (either
because White would have taken using that pawn, or black would have taken that
pawn directly, threatening White&rsquo;s rook on f1).</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Ne5</li>
</ol>
<p>White places their knight in the center of the board. The engine suggests this
as the best move.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>&hellip; Ne7</li>
</ol>
<p>Black moves the knight to occupy the square in front of the king, although it&rsquo;s
not attacking anything.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Qh5</li>
</ol>
<p>White attacks f7 both with the queen and the knight. White has 2 attackers, and
the king is the only defender.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>&hellip; Qc8</li>
</ol>
<p>The engine states that this is a major blunder. Black should have played Ng6 in
order to block White&rsquo;s queen from threatening mate on f7.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Nxf7</li>
</ol>
<p>White missed mate in 1. They should have attacked f7 using the queen instead,
which would have forced the king to retreat to d8 ending the game on the next
move with Qf8#.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>&hellip; Nbc6</li>
</ol>
<p>Black develops their knight, possibly with the intention of rerouting it to
attack White&rsquo;s knight.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Nd6+</li>
</ol>
<p>White performs a double check. The knight checks the king from its new
location, and also reveals a discovered attack by the queen. Furthermore, the
knight is also attacking Black&rsquo;s queen.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>&hellip; Kd8</li>
</ol>
<p>Black only had 2 legal moves, both of which allow mate in 1. If black has
played Kf8, then White could have responded with Qf7#.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Qe8#</li>
</ol>
<p>White wins.</p>
