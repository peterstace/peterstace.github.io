      <description>Enter Grayt Grayt (Go Ray Tracer) was a project that I started in mid 2014 to help me learn Go. As the name suggests, it started out as a ray tracer. Having implemented ray tracers before (in C++), this was quite straight forward but ultimately wasn&amp;rsquo;t very satisfying. I still wanted a side project to learn Go with, so I pivoted it from a ray tracer to a path tracer.</description>
