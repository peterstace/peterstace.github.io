<h2>Caliban&#39;s War</h2>
<p>James Corey &minus; Science fiction &minus; Mar. 2023</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

Caliban's War is the second book in The Expanse series. The novel follows the
crew of the Rocinante, who find themselves caught up in a solar system-wide
conspiracy involving a new form of alien life, a ruthless corporation, and a
power-hungry politician. The story also introduces new characters, including a
high-ranking UN official, a Martian Marine sergeant, and a scientist studying
the alien protomolecule. As tensions escalate and violence erupts, the fate of
humanity hangs in the balance. The novel explores themes of power, politics,
loyalty, and the consequences of humanity's actions.

<h2>Artemis</h2>
<p>Andy Weir &minus; Science fiction &minus; Feb. 2023</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

After thoroughly enjoying Andy Weir's The Martian and Project Hail Mary,
Artemis was a disappointment. The story follows Jazz, a resident of a moon
colony named Artemis, as she attempts to commit the perfect crime. The story
is okay, but nothing exceptional. It's predictable in many parts but still has
enough twists and turns to keep the reader off guard. The characters are
interesting, but none are particularly deep. I did enjoy the science fiction
elements, such as how a Moon colony could work from a technology and economic
perspective.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Leviathan Wakes</h2>
<p>James Corey &minus; Science fiction &minus; Jan. 2023</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

This is the first book in The Expanse series, a space western set in the
asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Expanse series is the basis for TV
series by the same name. I'm a big fan of the TV series, which prompted me to
pick this book up. I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed.  The main
differentiators compared to the TV series are that the pace is a bit slower,
and more time is spent going into details about how the space stations work,
the economy of the Belt, and the politics of the OPA.  There are only two
character-driven storylines (Holden and Miller), so things are much more
focused.

<h2>Gideon the Ninth</h2>
<p>Tamsyn Muir &minus; Science fantasy &minus; Dec. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★☆☆☆</p>
<p>

Gideon the Ninth is a mashup of fantasy, sci-fi, and who-dun-it. Basically,
it's "lesbian necromancers in space". It has excellent world-building, and I
enjoyed the well-balanced mix of poetic & flowery language with crass humour.
Ultimately, it has many weaknesses, making it hard to get through. Many minor
characters are shallow and indistinguishable, but they're so integral to the
story that they don't feel like minor characters. The writing is so confusing
that it's tough to understand who is talking to whom in some scenes. The actual
story didn't feel remarkable.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>A Desolation Called Peace</h2>
<p>Arkady Martine &minus; Science fiction &minus; Oct. to Nov. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

A Desolation Called Peace is the second book in the Teixcalaan duology.
Martine's brilliant world-building continues, but this time focussing on the
culture of Lsel Station and the Teixcalaan military fleet. It tackles some big
themes, particularly language, institutions, and colonialism. Collective
conciousness is a theme that is explored across multiple levels of abstraction,
which I found to be a really interesting idea. It would be rated a five, but
the increased number of characters compared to the first book make the story
harder to follow in some places.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Brave New World</h2>
<p>Aldous Huxley &minus; Dystopian fiction &minus; Oct. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

I originally read Brave New World in 2005 for a high school English class and
didn't get much out of it then. This time, I got much more out of it and
appreciated its commentary on themes such as individuality, happiness, truth,
free will, and state-controlled societies. I unfortunately didn't find the
narrative particularly compelling.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Heaven&#39;s River</h2>
<p>Dennis Taylor &minus; Science fiction &minus; Sep. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

Heaven's River is the fourth book in the Bobiverse series. It departs from the
style of books two and three, with much of the action taking place with the
Bobs controlling individual "Mannys" (human-sized personas) on an alien
megastructure. It's a refreshing change to the formula.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>1984</h2>
<p>George Orwell &minus; Dystopian fiction &minus; Sep. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

I enjoyed the exploration of some weighty themes in 1984. Propaganda, language
(as a general tool), control via history revision, loyalty, and actual
gaslighting. The world-building is decent, and the atmosphere is
well-constructed. The main thing that I didn't like about 1984 is that I didn't
like or relate to any of the characters.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Animal Farm</h2>
<p>George Orwell &minus; Political satire &minus; Aug. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

Animal Farm is short and fun parody about the Stalinist era of the Soviet
Union. It packs some heavy criticism towards the totalitarian side of
socialism, and touches on themes such as the failure of intellect and the
corruption of ideals. I enjoyed the playful style of writing.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Roadkill</h2>
<p>Dennis Taylor &minus; Science fiction &minus; Aug. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

Roadkill is about three friends who accidentally acquire a spaceship/sentient
AI, who they join on an adventure to save the human race. I found the book
entertaining, but ultimately the story and the characters are easily
forgettable.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>A Memory Called Empire</h2>
<p>Arkady Martine &minus; Science fiction &minus; Aug. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★★</p>
<p>

A Memory Called Empire is the first book in the Teixcalaan duology. It follows
Mahit, who is posted as the new ambassador of a small mining station to the
mighty Teixcalaan empire. The world-building is fantastic, and the story is
thoroughly interesting with political intrigue and drama. Some great themes are
explored, such as identity, imperialism, colonialism, language, and
independence. The quiet normalisation of queer relationships is a subtle but
nice touch.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>All These Worlds</h2>
<p>Dennis Taylor &minus; Science fiction &minus; Jul. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

All These Worlds is the third book in the Bobiverse series. It feels much like
the second book in the series and pales compared to the first. A savage new
alien threat takes centre stage, but much of the narrative focus is on combat
with the threat rather than exploring their history, society, and culture.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Shadow and Bone</h2>
<p>Leigh Bardugo &minus; Fantasy &minus; Jul. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

Shadow and Bone is a fantasy novel about a young woman whose newly surfaced
powers set her apart from her peers and put the balance of powers in the world
in jeopardy. The story and world-building felt a bit too predictable and
generic for my liking.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Destination: Void</h2>
<p>Frank Herbert &minus; Science fiction &minus; Jul. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★☆☆☆</p>
<p>

Destination: Void follows the story of a small group of clones who are
caretakers for a colony ship heading to Tau Ceti. Unbeknownst to them, they're
part of an experiment to create artificial consciousness. This fascinating
concept is executed poorly and hasn't aged well (the book was published in
1965). My main criticism is that the book spends significant time waffling on
about mathematically defining consciousness, and the techno-gobbledegook is
nearly incomprehensible. I struggled to get through it.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>The Egg and Other Stories</h2>
<p>Andy Weir &minus; Science fiction &minus; Jun. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

The Egg and Other Stories is a collection of nine very short standalone
stories. Each is excellent. Some whimsical and fun, and others are sad or
profound. Every story ends with an unexpected twist.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Enders Game</h2>
<p>Orson Scott Card &minus; Science fiction &minus; Jun. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

Ender's Game follows a young boy who is recruited by the military to attend
Battle School, a training facility for gifted children to become military
commanders in a war against an alien species known as the Buggers. As he
progresses through the ranks, he becomes increasingly conflicted about the
morality of the war and the toll it takes on him and his peers. I found the
story entertaining, but ultimately not a standout.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Flowers for Algernon</h2>
<p>Daniel Keyes &minus; Science fiction &minus; Jun. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★★</p>
<p>

Flowers for Algernon follows the life of Charlie Gordon, a man with a severe
intellectual disability. He is selected for an experimental surgery which
causes his IQ to rise dramatically, eventually surpassing that of his doctors
and colleagues. However, as Charlie becomes more intelligent, he becomes more
isolated and realizes the true nature of his relationships with those around
him, leading to a tragic conclusion.

I enjoyed the emotional depth and complexity of the characters in the story.
The exploration of how intelligence affects relationships and personal
fulfilment was profound.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>The Martian</h2>
<p>Andy Weir &minus; Science fiction &minus; Jun. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★★</p>
<p>

The Martian follows an astronaut stranded alone on Mars after his team is
forced to evacuate due to a severe dust storm. Believed to be dead and with no
means of communication, he must use his skills as a botanist and engineer to
survive on the hostile planet and find a way to signal Earth for a rescue
mission.

I enjoyed the hard science fiction aspects of the book, as well as its
emotional ups and downs as the story progresses.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Ubik</h2>
<p>Philip Dick &minus; Science fiction &minus; May 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

Ubik is set in an alternate reality where psychic abilities exist, and
corporations have monetised nearly every aspect of daily life. The story
follows a team of anti-psychics who gradually experience strange and
inexplicable phenomena. As the line between reality and illusion becomes
increasingly blurred, the team are forced to unravel the mystery of the
enigmatic substance called "Ubik".

I enjoyed the world-building and sense of mystery that was built up throughout
the novel. I was left guessing what was really going on right up until the very
end of the story.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Altered Carbon</h2>
<p>Richard Morgan &minus; Science fiction &minus; May 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

"Altered Carbon" is set in a future where human consciousness can be digitized
and transferred between bodies, known as "sleeves." The story follows a
mercenary who a wealthy businessman hires to investigate his murder.

I picked up this book because I enjoyed the TV series based on it. I enjoyed
the fast pace and grittiness of the book, but ultimately it didn't live up to
the TV series for me.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>For We Are Many</h2>
<p>Dennis Taylor &minus; Science fiction &minus; Apr. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

For We Are Many is the second book in the Bobiverse series. It picks up where
the story left off and follows the Bobs into their adventures through the local
star systems. Some interesting ideas are pursued, such as one of the Bobs
becoming a "sky god" to the local inhabitants of Delta Eridani and some
incredible battles between competing von Neumann probes. Its main fault is that
it doesn't feel as fresh as We are Legion by comparison.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>We are Legion (We are Bob)</h2>
<p>Dennis Taylor &minus; Science fiction &minus; Mar. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★★</p>
<p>

We are Legion is the first book in the Bobiverse series. It follows the story
of Bob, who dies in the 21st century and wakes up hundreds of years later about
to be inserted into a von Neumann probe as its controlling AI. This is an
intriguing and novel concept and is executed exceptionally well. I was
initially put off by the silliness of the title but got over that very quickly.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>The Scout Mindset</h2>
<p>Julia Galef &minus; Self help &minus; Mar. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★☆☆☆</p>
<p>

The Scout Mindset explores the idea of having a scout mindset versus a soldier
mindset. Scout mindset involves the ability to objectively evaluate
evidence and update beliefs based on new information, while soldier mindset
is focused on defending existing beliefs and biases.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>The Road</h2>
<p>Cormac McCarthy &minus; Post-apocalyptic &minus; Feb. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

The Road follows a father and his young son as they journey through a barren
and dangerous world. As they do so, the duo encounter various threats,
including hunger, cold, and roving bands of cannibals, all while trying to
maintain their humanity and love for each other.

I was taken by surprise at the deep, visceral reaction I had to the story.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Bullshit Jobs</h2>
<p>David Graeber &minus; Organisational culture &minus; Jan. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>

Bullshit Jobs explores the phenomenon of meaningless jobs that seem to serve no
purpose other than to keep people busy.

I found the enumeration of different flavours of bullshit jobs interesting, but
didn't get much else out of the book and found it hard to get through. The
discussion around Universal Basic Income as a solution to bullshit jobs was
very cliché.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Project Hail Mary</h2>
<p>Andy Weir &minus; Science fiction &minus; Dec. 2021</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★★</p>
<p>

Project Hail Mary follows a scientist who wakes up on a spaceship with no
memory of his past or why he's there. He soon discovers that he's on a mission
to save Earth from a single-cell organism, which is consuming the Sun's energy
and causing it to dim. The novel is a thrilling adventure that combines hard
science with a compelling story of survival and hope.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>A Hunter-Gatherer&#39;s Guide to the 21st Century: Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life</h2>
<p>Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein &minus; Science &minus; Dec. 2021</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century explores how human biology and
evolutionary history inform our current challenges and opportunities in the
modern world. Drawing on research from fields such as anthropology, biology,
and psychology, the authors examine topics such as human sexuality, social
hierarchies, and the role of technology in our lives. They argue that by
understanding our evolutionary past and how our biology shapes our behaviour,
we can better navigate the complexities of modern society and achieve greater
happiness and fulfilment. Overall, the book offers a thought-provoking and
insightful perspective on being human in the 21st century.

</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Atlas Shrugged</h2>
<p>Ayn Rand &minus; Philosophical fiction &minus; Aug. to Nov. 2021</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

Atlas Shrugged depicts a dystopian society in which its productive members go
on strike to protest against excessive regulation and interference in industry.
The story follows Dagny Taggart as she tries to save her family's struggling
railroad company. The novel deeply explores many different themes, including
property rights, libertarianism, capitalism, and the role of government.

My main criticism of the book is that the protagonists are unrealistic and
almost read as caricatures. This is partially redeemed by the portrayal of the
antagonists, who are very lifelike and realistic. Some of the ideas could have
been expressed in a more condensed way.
