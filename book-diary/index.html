<h2>Artemis</h2>
<p>Andy Weir &minus; Science fiction &minus; Feb. 2023</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★☆☆</p>
<p>

After thoroughly enjoying Andy Weir's The Martian and Project Hail Mary,
Artemis was a disappointment. The story is okay, but nothing exceptional. It's
predictable in many parts but still has enough twists and turns to keep the
reader off guard. The characters are interesting, but none are particularly
deep. I did enjoy the science fiction elements, such as how a Moon colony could
work from a technology and economic perspective.

<h2>Leviathan Wakes</h2>
<p>James Corey &minus; Science fiction &minus; Jan. 2023</p>
<p>Rating: ★★★★☆</p>
<p>

This is the first book in The Expanse series. The Expanse series is the basis
for TV series by the same name. I'm a big fan of the TV series, which prompted
me to pick this book up. I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed. The main
differentiators compared to the TV series are that the pace is a bit slower,
and more time is spent going into details about how the space stations work,
the economy of the Belt, and the politics of the OPA.  There are only two
character-driven storylines (Holden and Miller), so things are much more
focused.

<h2>Gideon the Ninth</h2>
<p>Tamsyn Muir &minus; Science fantasy &minus; Dec. 2022</p>
<p>Rating: ★★☆☆☆</p>
<p>

Gideon the Ninth is a mashup of fantasy, sci-fi, and who-dun-it. Basically,
it's "lesbian necromancers in space". It has excellent world-building, and I
enjoyed the well-balanced mix of poetic & flowery language with crass humour.
Ultimately, it has many weaknesses, making it hard to get through. Many minor
characters are shallow and indistinguishable, but they're so integral to the
story that they don't feel like minor characters. The writing is so confusing
that it's tough to understand who is talking to whom in some scenes. The actual
story didn't feel remarkable.
