<h2 id="enter-grayt">Enter Grayt</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/peterstace/grayt">Grayt</a> (<strong>G</strong>o <strong>Ray</strong> <strong>T</strong>racer) was a
project that I started in mid 2014 to help me learn <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>.
As the name suggests, it started out as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray
tracer</a>. Having
implemented ray tracers before (in C++), this was quite straight forward but
ultimately wasn&rsquo;t very satisfying.  I still wanted a side project to learn Go
with, so I pivoted it from a ray tracer to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">path
tracer</a>.  Path tracers are much
harder to implement, and produce more realistic renderings. The name &ldquo;Grayt&rdquo;
stuck, even if it&rsquo;s no longer a truly accurate name.</p>

<p>At its core, a path tracer takes a mathematical description of a 3D scene and
renders it, producing a 2D image. They&rsquo;re able to render highly photo realistic
images by simulating light related physical phenomena that occur in the real
wold.</p>

<p>Currently, Grayt only supports diffuse reflections. These types of reflections
are only a tiny subset of the reflections that occur in the real world.
However, they allow a path tracer to render matte objects with relative
accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="renders">Renders</h2>

<p>I started out with 3 different renderings, each showing off different aspects
of the path tracer.</p>

<h3 id="cornell-box">Cornell Box</h3>

<p>The first scene I implemented is the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box">Cornell
Box</a>, originally created at Cornell
University as a 3D test model. My take on the Cornell Box is slightly different
from the original.</p>

<p>The rendering contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>A red &lsquo;left&rsquo; wall.</li>
<li>A green &lsquo;right&rsquo; wall.</li>
<li>A white floor and ceiling.</li>
<li>A white ceiling light.</li>
<li>Two white blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>All surfaces are matte. A real wold example of a matte surface would be a
non-glossy and slightly rough painted surface.</p>

<p>In the rendering, you can observer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Soft shadows being cast by the blocks onto the floor.</li>
<li>Green and red light being reflected off the green and red walls onto the
white center blocks.</li>
<li>Occlusion shadows, most visible in the back top corners of the room.</li>
</ul>

<p>In a traditional ray tracer, these three effects must be implemented as special
cases (and it&rsquo;s very hard to do so accurately). In path tracing however, we get
them &lsquo;for free&rsquo; by virtue of having implemented diffuse reflections.</p>

<h3 id="split-box">Split Box</h3>

<p>My second rendering is of a procedurally generated scene of my own design.  I
started by taking a cube and splitting it into two pieces along a random axis.
I then moved each piece slightly against the other. I repeated this on the
remaining cubes over several dozen iterations. The cube stricture is white, and
is situated underneath a white light. Like the Cornell Box, there are coloured
walls to the left and right (off camera) that reflect coloured light into the
scene.</p>

<h3 id="sphere-tree">Sphere Tree</h3>

<p>My third rendering is also of a procedurally generated scene of my own design.
I created a &lsquo;tree&rsquo; structure out of spheres. I started with a large sphere
centered in the floor, and randomly added two &lsquo;child&rsquo; spheres to its surface. I
then added two more child spheres to each of the original child spheres. This
continued until I had several hundred spheres.</p>
