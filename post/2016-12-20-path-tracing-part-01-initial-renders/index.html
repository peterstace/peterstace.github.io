<h1>Path Tracing Part 1 - Initial Renders</h1>

<h2>2016-12-20</h2>



<h2 id="enter-grayt">Enter Grayt</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/peterstace/grayt">Grayt</a> (<strong>G</strong>o <strong>Ray</strong> <strong>T</strong>racer) was a
project that I started in mid 2014 to help me learn <a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>.
As the name suggests, it started out as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">ray
tracer</a>. Having
implemented ray tracers before (in C++), this was quite straight forward but
ultimately wasn&rsquo;t very satisfying.  I still wanted a side project to learn Go
with, so I pivoted it from a ray tracer to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">path
tracer</a>.  Path tracers are much
harder to implement, and produce more realistic renderings. The name &ldquo;Grayt&rdquo;
stuck, even if it&rsquo;s no longer a truly accurate name.</p>

<p>At its core, a path tracer takes a mathematical description of a 3D scene and
renders it, producing a 2D image. They&rsquo;re able to render highly photo realistic
images by simulating light related physical phenomena that occur in the real
wold.</p>

<p>Currently, Grayt only supports diffuse reflections. These types of reflections
are only a tiny subset of the reflections that occur in the real world.
However, they allow a path tracer to render matte objects with relative
accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="renders">Renders</h2>

<p>I started out with 3 different renderings, each showing off different aspects
of the path tracer.</p>

<h3 id="cornell-box">Cornell Box</h3>

<p>The first scene I implemented is the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_box">Cornell
Box</a>, originally created at Cornell
University as a 3D test model. My take on the Cornell Box is slightly different
from the original. In the rendering, you can diffuse reflections from the red
and green walls onto the center blocks. You can also see soft shadows cast by
the blocks onto the floor.</p>

<h3 id="split-box">Split Box</h3>

<p>My second rendering is of a procedurally generated scene of my own design. I
took a cube, and repeatedly split it into two pieces along a random axis,
shifting each piece slightly against the other.</p>

<h3 id="sphere-tree">Sphere Tree</h3>

<p>My third rendering is also of a procedurally generated scene of my own design.
I created a &lsquo;tree&rsquo; out of sphere, attaching each child sphere to its parent
sphere at a random location.</p>
